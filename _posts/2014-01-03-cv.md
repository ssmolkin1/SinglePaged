# Upload your resume or CV

Sign into Google Drive with your [**new Gmail account**](https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/identifier?service=wise&passive=true&continue=http%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2F%3Futm_source%3Den_US&utm_medium=button&utm_campaign=web&utm_content=gotodrive&usp=gtd&ltmpl=drive&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=ServiceLogin) and upload your resume or CV. Make sure you've polished your resume or CV before uploading, since your Helper will be sending this document to your potential employers. However, it's no problem if you want to make changes to your resume or CV later or upload a new version &mdash; you can do so at any time.
