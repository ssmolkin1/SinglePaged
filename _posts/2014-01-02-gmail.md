# Make a new Gmail account

To use Jobi, you will need to make a [**new** Gmail account](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?service=mail&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail%2F&ltmpl=default). This Gmail account will be shared with Jobi's Helpers, so you must choose a **new password which you do not use for any other purpose**.

After you make your account, you must also [**turn off 2-Step Verification**](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1064203?hl=en).

Your Helper will use this new email address to access and process your job applications. Your Helper will also use this account's Google Drive to store your store your resume or CV and any other documents. Since you share the account, you will have real-time access to all application related emails, and you can respond directly to any follow up emails from interested employers!

Since this will be a shared account, **you must not use this account for any purpose other than job applications with Jobi**.
